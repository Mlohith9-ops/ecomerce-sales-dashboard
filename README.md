E-Commerce Sales Dashboard (Power BI)
This project is an interactive E-Commerce Sales Dashboard built using **Power BI**.  
I used a real sample dataset to explore sales trends, customer orders, revenue patterns, and overall business performance.

What the Dashboard Shows->
Total Sales:
Overall revenue generated.

Total Orders:  
Total number of customer orders.

Average Order Value (AOV):  
Average revenue per order — calculated using a custom DAX measure.

Sales by Month:
A line/area chart showing how sales change across months.

Sales by Country:
Which countries contribute the most to revenue.

Sales by Product / Category:
Top-performing products and categories.

Tools Used->
- Power BI Desktop  
- Power Query (for cleaning the dataset)  
- DAX (for AOV and calculated Sales column)  
- CSV dataset

Files in This Project:
- sales_data.csv – raw dataset  
- ecommerce_sales_dashboard.pbix – final Power BI dashboard  
- README.md – this file  

Key Learning Outcomes->
While making this dashboard, I learned:
- How to clean and transform data inside Power BI
